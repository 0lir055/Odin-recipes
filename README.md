The current project that I am working on is part of a free-course which I am taking to help aid in my career path of web development. This project is making a recipes website using HTML.

Upon completing this project, I have demonstrated how to add images to a HTML page, creating lists, using appropriate font sizes, and referencing different files from seperate folders.
